# Kenzi | Abacus Trainer (Kids) — v14
**What’s new**
- Clear result banner with animation: green ✓ for correct, red ✗ with the right answer for wrong.
- Desktop width tuned (max 1040px) so you don’t need to zoom out.
- Start button re‑enabled right after the last number: you can start a **new run** even if you didn’t submit.
- All v13 mobile fixes kept (controls first, anti‑zoom, keypad).
